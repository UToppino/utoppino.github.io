# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
My current goal is to complete my education while working to gain professional experience in my field of interest.
During my university courses I learned the basics of electronics, spanning from analog to digital circuits, high and low level programming and FPGA programming using VHDL. I also had the possibility to work in groups, learning how to manage and develop bigger projects. 
I'm a good team worker, very result-driven and motivated by new challenges. I'm looking forward to traveling both nationally and internationally if my job requires it.
